MultiThreading
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multithreading in Java is a feature that enables a program to run multiple threads simultaneously, allowing tasks to execute in parallel and utilize the CPU more efficiently. A thread is a lightweight, independent unit of execution inside a program (process).
A process can have multiple threads.
Each thread runs independently but shares the same memory.

Example: Imagine a restaurant kitchen. Multiple chefs (threads) are preparing different dishes at the same time. This speeds up service and utilizes all available resources (CPU).

Threads can be created by using two mechanisms:
 * 1. Extending the Thread class
 * 2. Implementing the Runnable interface
 
When to Use Which?
 * Use extends Thread: if your class does not extend any other class.
 * Use implements Runnable: if your class already extends another class (preferred because Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance).

Advantages of Multithreading in Java
 * Improved Performance: Multiple tasks can run simultaneously, reducing execution time.
 * Efficient CPU Utilization: Threads keep the CPU busy by running tasks in parallel.
 * Responsiveness: Applications (like GUIs) remain responsive while performing background tasks.
 * Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share memory and resources, avoiding duplication.
 * Better User Experience: Smooth execution of tasks like file downloads, animations, and real-time updates.
